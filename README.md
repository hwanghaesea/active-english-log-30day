# ✍️ Active English Learning Log - 30-day challenge
This is a personal English learning tool built to bridge the gap between passive recognition and active speaking. Instead of relying on AI-generated sentences, this app encourages users to manually translate their own thoughts into English.

# 🧪 The Experiment: v0 vs. Base44
As a technical experiment, I built two distinct versions of this application using different AI-native development tools to compare their output and DX (Developer Experience):

- Version A (v0): Focused on sleek UI components and Shadcn integration.

- Version B (Base44): Focused on robust state management and logic-heavy workflows.

Both versions follow the same core philosophy of "Active Learning."

# ✨ Key Features
- 30-Day Structured Curriculum: From self-introductions to complex problem-solving scenarios.

- Active Recall Interface: Dual-input system (Korean Top / English Bottom) to facilitate mental translation.

- Review Mode: Side-by-side comparison view for effective script memorization.

- Dynamic Vocab Builder: Personalized database for context-specific expressions.

- Privacy Focused: All data is stored locally in your browser (LocalStorage).

# 🛠 Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)

- Styling: Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI

- State Management: React Hooks & LocalStorage

- Theme: Obsidian-inspired Minimalist UI (Dark/Light Mode)

# 🚀 Purpose
The goal of this project was to build a distraction-free, "no-AI" content generation environment. By forcing the user to manually type and translate, it ensures that every word in the 1.5-minute OPIc script actually belongs to the learner's active vocabulary.
